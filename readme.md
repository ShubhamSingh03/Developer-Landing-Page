## Description

This project [Developer Landing Page]() was built using Semantic HTML and CSS. The main aim was to make the webpage responsive for all major devices.The difficulty was faced while making webpage responsive with **@media queries**. Making the webpage responsive was way time-consuming but I learnt alot. Also learnt about various flexbox properties and handling different sections on a webpage. The Project was completed under guidance of [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), CTO Ineuron
